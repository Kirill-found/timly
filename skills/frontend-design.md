## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth.

NEVER use generic AI aesthetics: overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial), cliched color schemes (purple gradients), predictable layouts.
